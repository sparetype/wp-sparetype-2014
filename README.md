# wp-sparetype-2014


WordPress theme for redesign of SpareType in 2014

This repository is a learning curve bender for me as I'm figuring out Git, Markdown, Sass,
and a new developement environment with Codio. All while trying to build a new WordPress theme.

### Goals

- Setup Github and Codio accounts
- Issue first adds and commits to learn Git
- Expand README with Markdown
- Copy over current theme's file structure
- Evaluate file structure and make changes
- Test deployment from Codio
